// My First Program for Java
// This program prints out "Hello, My Parents!" to the console

class HelloMyParents {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, MyParents!");
    }
}
// In my personal opinion, I think that the Java language is a bit more complex
// than the Python language.
// This is because that the Java language has more syntax and rules to follow.
// It should be improved in the future
// otherwise it will be eliminated by other programming languages. For example,
// in the Java language there are classes
// and objects, and in the Python language there are no classes and objects. In
// the Java language, there are more
// rules to follow than the Python language. Overall, the Java language is a bit
// more complex than the Python language.
// However, it is very important to learn the Java language because it is one of
// the most popular programming language
// in the world. Programming skills becomes more important nowadays. Therefore,
// it is still very important to learn
// the Java programming language.
