// My First Program for Java
// This is a simple program that prints out "Hello, My Parents!" to the console
// Teammate: Lim Jie Han (A21EC3013)

class HelloMyParents {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, MyParents!");
    }

// In my personal opinion, I think that the Java language is a bit more complex
// than the Python language. This is because that the Java language has more
// syntax and rules to follow. It should be improved in the future
// otherwise it will be eliminated by other programming languages.
// For example, in the Java language there are classes and objects, and in the
// Python language there are no classes and objects. In the Java language,
// there are more rules to follow than the Python language. Overall, the Java
// language is a bit more complex than the Python language. However, it is
// very important to learn the Java language because it is still one of the most
// popular
// programming language in the world. Overall, the programming skills becomes
// more important nowadays so it is still very important to learn the Java
// programming language.
